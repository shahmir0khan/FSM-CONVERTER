# FSM Converter: Mealy to Moore and Moore to Mealy

## Overview

This program is a Finite State Machine (FSM) converter that transforms Mealy machines into equivalent Moore machines and vice versa. It provides an interactive console interface for users to input the details of their FSMs and view the converted FSMs.

## Features

- **Mealy to Moore Conversion**: Converts a Mealy machine into an equivalent Moore machine.
- **Moore to Mealy Conversion**: Converts a Moore machine into an equivalent Mealy machine.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Users can input their FSM details and choose the conversion type through a user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

### Mealy to Moore Conversion

The program reads the number of states and input symbols in the Mealy machine. It then prompts for the transition and output functions. The conversion process involves creating a new set of states for the Moore machine, ensuring that each output in the Mealy machine corresponds to a unique state in the Moore machine.

### Moore to Mealy Conversion

For converting Moore to Mealy machines, the program reads the number of states and input symbols, and the transition function along with the output for each state. The Mealy machine is generated by associating each output with a corresponding transition, maintaining the state transitions as in the Moore machine.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```sh
   g++ -o fsm_converter fsm_converter.cpp
